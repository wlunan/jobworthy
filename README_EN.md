## Why this exists

Campus recruitment information is scattered across 100+ company career pages. Fresh graduates spend hours checking each site manually.  
**JobWorthy** automates the crawl and presents everything in one searchable table with category filters, pagination, and batch import.

## Quick start

### Option A: Firecrawl (no login required)

1. Get a free API key from [Firecrawl](https://www.firecrawl.dev/app/api-keys)
2. Open `index.html` in your browser
3. Paste your Firecrawl API key → click **🕷 Crawl**
4. First 20 sites load instantly; remaining sites load in the background

### Option B: BrowserAct CLI (for anti-bot / captcha sites)

```bash
npm install -g browser-act
browser-act login
browser-act stealth-extract "https://join.qq.com/" --out ba_result.json
```

Then click **📤 Import** in the radar page and select `ba_result.json`.

### Option C: OpenCLI xiaozhao adapter (for 51job full database)

```bash
npm install -g @jackwener/opencli
opencli xiaozhao search "2027 校招" -f json > xiaozhao.json
```

Then click **📤 Import** in the radar page and select `xiaozhao.json`.
